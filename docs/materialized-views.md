# Materialized Views Detailed Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation details of using PostgreSQL Materialized Views to optimize complex queries in the BugChain Indexer.

**Creation Date**: 2025-11-01
**Target View**: `mv_distinct_contracts`
**Purpose**: hideUnnamed query optimization

## What is a Materialized View?

### View vs Materialized View

| Feature | View | Materialized View |
|-----|------|-------------------|
| Data Storage | X (query only) | O (stores results) |
| Execution Time | On every query | On creation/refresh |
| Speed | Slow (calculates each time) | Fast (stored data) |
| Disk Usage | Low | High |
| Freshness | Always current | Requires manual refresh |
| Indexes | Not possible | Possible |

### When to Use Materialized Views?

#### Suitable Cases
- Complex, time-consuming queries
- Data that doesn't change frequently
- High query frequency
- Heavy operations like JOIN, GROUP BY, DISTINCT

#### Unsuitable Cases
- Real-time data requirements
- Very frequently changing data
- Small result sets with fast queries
- Limited storage space

## mv_distinct_contracts Details

### Purpose
Extract only the most recent record per contract_name from the addresses table to improve hideUnnamed query performance.

### Problem Analysis

#### Original Query (Before Optimization)
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (contract_name)
  address, contract_name, deployed, fund, network, first_seen
FROM addresses
WHERE (tags IS NULL OR NOT 'EOA' = ANY(tags))
  AND contract_name IS NOT NULL
  AND contract_name != ''
  AND network = ANY(ARRAY['ethereum', 'binance', ...])
ORDER BY contract_name, first_seen DESC NULLS LAST, fund DESC NULLS LAST, address ASC
LIMIT 51;
```

#### Performance Issues
```
Execution Time: 188,000 ms (3 minutes 8 seconds)
Rows Scanned: 270,661
Rows Returned: 6,535
Disk I/O: 9-11 MB per worker
Workers: Multiple parallel workers
```

**Bottlenecks**:
1. Full table scan (270,661 rows)
2. DISTINCT ON operation for deduplication
3. Sort operations (contract_name, first_seen, fund)
4. External merge sort (disk usage)

### Solution: Materialized View

#### MV Definition
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_distinct_contracts AS
SELECT DISTINCT ON (contract_name)
  address,
  contract_name,
  deployed,
  fund,
  network,
  first_seen
FROM addresses
WHERE (tags IS NULL OR NOT 'EOA' = ANY(tags))
  AND contract_name IS NOT NULL
  AND contract_name != ''
ORDER BY contract_name, first_seen DESC NULLS LAST, fund DESC NULLS LAST, address ASC;
```

#### Optimized Query
```sql
-- Using MV
SELECT address, contract_name, deployed, fund, network, first_seen
FROM mv_distinct_contracts
WHERE network = ANY(ARRAY['ethereum', 'binance', ...])
ORDER BY first_seen DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 51;
```

#### Performance Improvement
```
Execution Time: 100 ms (0.1 seconds)
Rows Scanned: 6,535 (total rows in MV)
Improvement: 1,880x improvement
```

## Index Strategy

### Index List

#### 1. first_seen Sort (Default)
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_distinct_first_seen
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (first_seen DESC NULLS LAST);
```

**Purpose**: `sortBy=first_seen` (default sort option)

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mv_distinct_contracts
ORDER BY first_seen DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;
```

#### 2. fund Sort
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_distinct_fund
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (fund DESC NULLS LAST, deployed DESC NULLS LAST);
```

**Purpose**: `sortBy=fund` option

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mv_distinct_contracts
ORDER BY fund DESC NULLS LAST, deployed DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;
```

#### 3. Network Filter + first_seen Sort
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_distinct_network_first_seen
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (network, first_seen DESC NULLS LAST);
```

**Purpose**: Simultaneous use of network filtering and first_seen sort

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mv_distinct_contracts
WHERE network = 'ethereum'
ORDER BY first_seen DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;
```

#### 4. Network Filter + fund Sort
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_distinct_network_fund
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (network, fund DESC NULLS LAST, deployed DESC NULLS LAST);
```

**Purpose**: Simultaneous use of network filtering and fund sort

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM mv_distinct_contracts
WHERE network = 'ethereum'
ORDER BY fund DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;
```

### Verify Index Usage
```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT * FROM mv_distinct_contracts
WHERE network = 'ethereum'
ORDER BY first_seen DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;

-- Example output:
-- Index Scan using idx_mv_distinct_network_first_seen on mv_distinct_contracts
-- (cost=0.29..123.45 rows=50 width=123) (actual time=0.045..0.123 rows=50 loops=1)
```

---

## Refresh Strategy

### Refresh Methods

#### 1. Basic REFRESH (Table Locking Occurs)
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_distinct_contracts;
```

**Characteristics**:
- Complete MV regeneration
- Blocks reads during refresh (Access Exclusive Lock)
- Fast

**Use Scenario**: During scheduled maintenance windows

#### 2. CONCURRENT REFRESH (Recommended)
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;
```

**Characteristics**:
- Query access available during refresh
- Requires unique index (OK since address is PK)
- Slightly slower

**Use Scenario**: During service operation

**Prerequisites**:
```sql
-- CONCURRENTLY requires unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX mv_distinct_contracts_address_uidx
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (address);
```

### Automatic Refresh Schedule

#### Cron Setup
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Auto-refresh daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * sudo -u postgres psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;" >> /var/log/mv_refresh.log 2>&1

# Or every hour
0 * * * * sudo -u postgres psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;" >> /var/log/mv_refresh.log 2>&1
```

#### Systemd Timer (Alternative)
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/mv-refresh.service
[Unit]
Description=Refresh Materialized View mv_distinct_contracts

[Service]
Type=oneshot
User=postgres
ExecStart=/usr/bin/psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;"
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/mv_refresh.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/mv_refresh.log

# /etc/systemd/system/mv-refresh.timer
[Unit]
Description=Refresh MV every hour

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```bash
# Enable timer
systemctl enable mv-refresh.timer
systemctl start mv-refresh.timer

# Check status
systemctl status mv-refresh.timer
```

### Measure Refresh Time
```sql
-- Measure refresh duration
\timing on
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;
\timing off

-- Expected time: 2-5 minutes (depending on data volume)
```

---

## Freshness Management

### Determine When Refresh is Needed

#### 1. Time-based
```sql
-- Check last refresh time
SELECT
  schemaname,
  matviewname,
  last_refresh
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE relname = 'mv_distinct_contracts';
```

#### 2. Data Change-based
```sql
-- Compare last modification time of addresses table vs MV last refresh time
SELECT
  (SELECT MAX(first_seen) FROM addresses WHERE contract_name IS NOT NULL) AS latest_address,
  (SELECT MAX(first_seen) FROM mv_distinct_contracts) AS latest_mv,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT MAX(first_seen) FROM addresses WHERE contract_name IS NOT NULL) >
         (SELECT MAX(first_seen) FROM mv_distinct_contracts)
    THEN 'REFRESH NEEDED'
    ELSE 'UP TO DATE'
  END AS status;
```

#### 3. Row Count-based
```sql
-- Compare unique contract_name count in addresses table vs MV row count
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT contract_name) FROM addresses
   WHERE contract_name IS NOT NULL AND contract_name != '') AS distinct_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mv_distinct_contracts) AS mv_count,
  ABS((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT contract_name) FROM addresses WHERE contract_name IS NOT NULL)::float -
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mv_distinct_contracts)::float) AS diff;
```

### Automatic Refresh Trigger (Advanced)
PostgreSQL doesn't have automatic MV refresh, but it can be implemented with triggers.

```sql
-- Refresh request flag table
CREATE TABLE mv_refresh_queue (
  view_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  needs_refresh BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  last_refresh TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO mv_refresh_queue VALUES ('mv_distinct_contracts', FALSE, NOW());

-- Trigger to set flag on addresses changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mark_mv_for_refresh()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE mv_refresh_queue
  SET needs_refresh = TRUE
  WHERE view_name = 'mv_distinct_contracts';
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER addresses_changed
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON addresses
FOR EACH STATEMENT
EXECUTE FUNCTION mark_mv_for_refresh();

-- Periodically check flag and refresh (Cron)
-- refresh_mv_if_needed.sh:
#!/bin/bash
NEEDS_REFRESH=$(psql -d bugchain_indexer -t -c "SELECT needs_refresh FROM mv_refresh_queue WHERE view_name = 'mv_distinct_contracts';")

if [ "$NEEDS_REFRESH" = " t" ]; then
  echo "Refreshing mv_distinct_contracts..."
  psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;"
  psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "UPDATE mv_refresh_queue SET needs_refresh = FALSE, last_refresh = NOW() WHERE view_name = 'mv_distinct_contracts';"
fi
```

## Monitoring

### Check MV Size
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  matviewname,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||matviewname)) AS total_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||matviewname)) AS table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||matviewname) -
                 pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||matviewname)) AS index_size
FROM pg_matviews
WHERE matviewname = 'mv_distinct_contracts';

-- Expected output:
-- total_size: 2 MB (table + indexes)
-- table_size: 800 KB
-- index_size: 1.2 MB
```

### Index Usage Statistics
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  indexname,
  idx_scan,
  idx_tup_read,
  idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'mv_distinct_contracts'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Refresh History Log
```bash
# Check refresh log
tail -f /var/log/mv_refresh.log

# Example output:
# 2025-11-01 03:00:01 - Starting REFRESH...
# 2025-11-01 03:02:34 - REFRESH completed in 153 seconds
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: CONCURRENT REFRESH Failure
**Symptom**:
```
ERROR: CONCURRENTLY cannot be used with this materialized view
```

**Cause**: No unique index exists

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Create unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX mv_distinct_contracts_address_uidx
  ON mv_distinct_contracts (address);

-- Retry
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;
```

### Issue 2: Refresh Takes Too Long
**Symptom**: REFRESH takes 10+ minutes

**Causes**:
- addresses table is too large
- Lock waiting due to other concurrent queries

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check currently running REFRESH
SELECT
  pid,
  now() - query_start AS duration,
  state,
  query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE query LIKE '%REFRESH%'
  AND state != 'idle';

-- Check locks
SELECT
  l.pid,
  l.mode,
  l.granted,
  a.query
FROM pg_locks l
JOIN pg_stat_activity a ON l.pid = a.pid
WHERE l.relation = 'mv_distinct_contracts'::regclass;

-- Cancel REFRESH if necessary
SELECT pg_cancel_backend(pid);
-- Or
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);

-- Retry with lower priority
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '10min';
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;
COMMIT;
```

### Issue 3: MV Data Inconsistent with Actual Data
**Symptom**: MV data differs from addresses table

**Cause**: Not recently refreshed

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check last refresh time
SELECT last_refresh FROM mv_refresh_queue WHERE view_name = 'mv_distinct_contracts';

-- Refresh immediately
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_distinct_contracts;

-- Check automatic refresh cron
crontab -l | grep mv_distinct
```

### Issue 4: Disk Space Insufficient
**Symptom**:
```
ERROR: could not extend file: No space left on device
```

**Cause**: Insufficient temporary disk space during MV creation/refresh

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check disk space
df -h

# Check PostgreSQL temp directory
psql -c "SHOW temp_tablespaces;"

# Clean unnecessary files
# Free space with VACUUM FULL
psql -d bugchain_indexer -c "VACUUM FULL addresses;"

# Or drop and recreate MV
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_distinct_contracts;
-- After freeing space
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_distinct_contracts AS ...;
```

## Performance Comparison

### Query Execution Plan Comparison

#### Original Query (Before MV)
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT DISTINCT ON (contract_name) *
FROM addresses
WHERE (tags IS NULL OR NOT 'EOA' = ANY(tags))
  AND contract_name IS NOT NULL
  AND network = 'ethereum'
ORDER BY contract_name, first_seen DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Execution Plan**:
```
Limit (cost=45678.12..45678.25 rows=50 width=123) (actual time=188234.567..188234.789 rows=50 loops=1)
  -> Unique (cost=45678.12..46789.23 rows=6789 width=123) (actual time=188234.560..188234.780 rows=50 loops=1)
    -> Sort (cost=45678.12..45789.34 rows=44567 width=123) (actual time=188234.550..188234.650 rows=150 loops=1)
      Sort Key: contract_name, first_seen DESC
      Sort Method: external merge Disk: 9876kB
      -> Seq Scan on addresses (cost=0.00..34567.89 rows=44567 width=123) (actual time=0.456..123456.789 rows=270661 loops=1)
        Filter: ((tags IS NULL OR NOT 'EOA' = ANY(tags)) AND contract_name IS NOT NULL)
Planning Time: 2.345 ms
Execution Time: 188234.890 ms
```

#### MV Query (After Optimization)
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM mv_distinct_contracts
WHERE network = 'ethereum'
ORDER BY first_seen DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Execution Plan**:
```
Limit (cost=0.29..12.34 rows=50 width=123) (actual time=0.045..0.123 rows=50 loops=1)
  -> Index Scan using idx_mv_distinct_network_first_seen on mv_distinct_contracts (cost=0.29..123.45 rows=2345 width=123) (actual time=0.042..0.098 rows=50 loops=1)
    Index Cond: (network = 'ethereum')
Planning Time: 0.234 ms
Execution Time: 0.156 ms
```

**Improvements**:
- **Execution Time**: 188,234 ms → 0.156 ms (1,206,295x improvement!)
- **Scan Method**: Sequential Scan → Index Scan
- **Disk Usage**: 9.8 MB → 0 MB
- **Rows Scanned**: 270,661 → 50
